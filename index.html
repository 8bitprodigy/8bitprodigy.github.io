          This is a first person shooter controller I made in the Godot engine. I got pretty far along and it includes the following features:
          <ul>
            <li>Walking, stair-stepping, crouching, leaning, sprinting, sneaking, jumping, Source Engine-style ladder Sclimbing, and swimming</li>
            <li>Head-bobbing dependent upon speed and ambulation type</li>
            <li>Procedural weapon sway, bobbing, and inertia</li>
            <li>Weapons have procedural vertical and horizongal muzzle climb, recoil, accuracy, and precision settings.</li>
            <li>Bullet spread can be affected by how long you fire. If the barrel overheats, that could permanently affect accuracy and precision.</li>
            <li>Bullets are projectiles that travel through space over time and are affected by gravity. Their trajectory is determined when they're fired.</li>
            <li>Bullets leave material-dependent decals on impact -- wood splinters, metal dents, glass cracks, dirt craters, etc...</li>
            <li>Buttons, dials, doors, and gates are available as interactable elements and can have their inputs and outputs chained together like in the Source Engine.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Tank reticle to show leg orientation relative to turret orientation</li>
            <li>Aiming is driven by mouse direction, rather than mapped directly to mouse movement.</li>
            <li>movement is relative to leg orientation. Legs are rotated by key inputs.</li>

          This is an RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator in Nim. It operates with a stack-based language with if/else statements, variables, and function declaration, which should, in theory, make it turing-complete.

          The Nim Unstructured/Useless Text Editor. This is a line text editor I made as an exercise to learn Nim and make use of its built in types. It stores a document line by line in an AVL tree, and it makes editing the text document much like entering a program into an 80's microcomputer. To enter text, you type the number for its line, followed by a space, and then the text you wish to enter. If there's a line number collision, it replaces the old line, but if not, it's entered into the AVL tree, which then self-balances.

          This is the Atlas Window Manager. AtlasWM aims to be a lightweight, but featureful, and user-friendly window manager for X11, based on Joe's Window Manager (JWM), that only uses permissively-licensed code and libraries, as it will be the default window manager for AcephalOS and eventually PrometheusOS.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Currently, I've replaced Cairo/libRSVG with <a href="https://github.com/sammycage/plutosvg" alt="Link to the PlutoSVG Github repo.">PlugoSVG</a>, and have enhanced the customizability of the motif theme to enable greater readability, and am currently working on replacing Pango/XFT with <a href="https://github.com/tomolt/libschrift" alt="Link to the libSchrift Github repo.">libSchrift</a>. I intend to extend its features, with some of the main ones being tababble w      left: 50%;
      transform: translate(-50%, 0%);indows, like in Haiku or FluxBox, and a global menu panel item.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          AtlasWM is currently in alpha stages, and most planned features are not yet implemented. Many things are likely subject to change, so it is not recommended for daily use.
